            the ratio of reacting species. If the concentration of one of the solutions is known, the
            concentrations of the others can be determined from the volumes used.

            <h2>Model 1: Concentration</h2>     
        <p>
            Most chemical reactions occur in solution, including almost all of those occurring in our bodies.
            When dealing with solutions, we measure out volumes instead of weighing out quantities. Volume
            is related to the number of moles present using the concentration or molarity. Concentration
            (symbol c) is defined as the number of moles of a substance dissolved in one litre of solution:
            <br><br />
            c (mol/L) = n (mol)/ V (L)
            <br><br />
            <h3>Critical thinking questions</h3>
            1. The units of concentration are often written as M. Use the equation above to work out the
            units of concentration in terms of mol and L.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            2. What is the concentration of the solution obtained when 0.50 mol of NaCl is dissolved into
            0.20 L of water?
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            3. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans around Australia is about 0.05 × 10 -3 M.
            How many moles of CO 2 are present in 3.2 L of seawater?
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            4. What mass of CO 2 does this correspond to?
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            5. A 500. mL solution of HCl with a concentration of 0.10 M is diluted to 1500. mL. What is the
            new concentration? (Hint: work out the number of moles present.)
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            When dealing with dilutions such as those in questions 5 and 6, a handy trick can be used. If the
            concentration and volume of the initial solution are c1 and V1 respectively and the concentration
            and volume of the final solution are c2 and V2 respectively then the number of moles present in
            each is:
            <br /><br />
            moles present initially = n = c1V1
            <br />
            moles present in diluted solution = n = c2V2
            <br /><br />
            The number of moles is unchanged when a solution is diluted, so n is the same for these two
            equations. Hence:
            <br />
            c1V1 = c2V2
            <br /><br />
            7. 300. mL of a 0.25 M solution of NaCl is diluted to 500. mL. What is the new concentration?
            <br /><br />
            <br />
            <br />
            8. What volume of water must be added to 2.0 L of 5.0 M HCl solution to reduce its
            concentration to 0.70 M?
            <br /></br>

            When ionic salts are dissolved in water, the solid splits up into cations and anions. For example:
            <br /><br />
            NaCl(s) → Na +(aq) + Cl–(aq) (1)
            <br /><br />
            A solution of NaCl contains equal amounts of Na +(aq) and Cl–(aq). A 0.10 M solution of NaCl is
            0.10 M in Na +(aq) and 0.10 M in Cl–(aq).
            <br />
            When MgCl2(s) dissolves in water, the ionic equation is:
            <br /><br />
            MgCl2(s) → Mg 2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq) (2)
            <br /><br />
            A solution of MgCl2 contains twice as much Cl–(aq) as Mg 2+(aq). A 0.10 M solution of MgCl2 is
            0.10 M in Mg 2+(aq) but 0.20 M in Cl–(aq).
            <br />
            When writing concentrations of the species in solution, square brackets are used around the
            species. For example, in the solutions above:
            <br />
            (1) [Na +(aq)] = 0.10 M and [Cl–(aq)] = 0.10 M
            <br />
            (2) [Mg 2+(aq)] = 0.10 M and [Cl–(aq)] = 0.20 M
            <br />

            1. Write the ionic equation for the dissolution of the following salts:

        <p>
            To work out the concentration of different table vinegars, a food chemist reacts a solution of brand
            A with 25 mL of a 0.100 M stock NaOH solution. Vinegar is CH3COOH and it reacts with OH- as
            below:
            <br />
            <br />
            CH3COOH(aq) + OH–(aq) → CH3CO 2–(aq) + H2O(l)
            <br />
            <br />
            1. What is the concentration of OH–(aq) in the stock NaOH solution? (Hint: remember to use
            the square bracket notation.)
            <br /><br />
            2. How many moles of OH–(aq) are present in 25 mL?
            <br /><br />
            3. In the experiment, the food chemist needs 28 mL of vinegar to completely react with the
            hydroxide solution. From the chemical equation, how many moles of CH3COOH must this
            volume contain?
            <br /><br />
            4. What is the concentration of brand A?
            <br /><br />
            5. Brand B claims to have a concentration of 0.10 M. What volume of this vinegar would be
            needed to completely react with the hydroxide solution if this claim is true?
            <br /><br />
            6. To check the results obtained from this analysis, a second laboratory tests the same
            vinegars using 25 mL of a 0.025 M solution of Ca(OH)2. Using the concentrations you
            calculated above, work out the volumes of each brand needed to completely react with the
            calcium hydroxide solution.
            <br />
            (a) Brand A
